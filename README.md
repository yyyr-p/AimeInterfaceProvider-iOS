# AimeInterfaceProvider-iOS

A project modified from [something cool with CoreNFC](https://github.com/kjj6198/swift-core-nfc-reader).

## Tips

- Run [aimeio-socket-client](https://github.com/yyyr-p/aimeio-socket-client) on your computer.
- Connect them with a USB cable. It runs on usbmuxd.
- Mount [aimeio-socket](https://github.com/yyyr-p/aimeio-socket).dll into some mysterious injecting tool?
- FeliCaâ„¢ Cards only at the moment.

## Requirements

- iOS 14.0 or later
- CoreNFC

**Attention**: You need an Apple Developer Account to sign apps with CoreNFC entitlements. TrollStore *may* work, but I haven't tested it.
